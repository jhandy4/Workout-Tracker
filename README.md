# Workout Tracker

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

   1. Click on "New Workout" or "Continue Workout".
   2. "New" will allow you to add a new exercise.  Click complete when you are done.
